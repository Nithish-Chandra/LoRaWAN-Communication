# LoRaWAN-Communication
The project uses LoRaWAN to monitor temperature, pressure, and humidity with sensors like Gy-Bm Bmp280 and DHT22, connected to LoRaWAN ESP32 boards. Data is sent wirelessly to a LoRa 32 LiLygo module

The purpose of this project is to enable remote and wireless monitoring of environmental parameters, specifically temperature, pressure, and humidity. By utilizing the LoRaWAN protocol, the system achieves long-range communication with low-power devices, making it suitable for 10T applications. The LoRaWAN technology allows for efficient data transmission over extended distances while conserving battery power.

Through the integration of sensors, LoRaWAN communication, and database storage, the environmental monitoring system provides real-time and historical data insights. Users can analyze the data trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on the recorded information. The system offers scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for various applications, such as agriculture, weather monitoring, and industrial processes.

Overall, the developed environmental monitoring system showcases the capabilities of LoRaWAN technology and its relevance in the 10T landscape. It highlights the importance of efficient data acquisition, wireless communication, and data visualization for effective environmental monitoring and decision-making.
